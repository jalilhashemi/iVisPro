    <h1 class="display-4">Changes in foreign resident population in the city of Zürich</h1>
    <p class="lead">The story of Zürich as a history of immigration</p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p class="paragraph part1">When Zürich developed into a metropolis at the turn of the 20th century due to <strong>industrialization</strong>  and consequent rural
      depopulation, immigrants played a major role in construction. Hence, by the year 1912 immigrants represented <strong>34.2%</strong> of
      Zurich’s population.</p>
    <p class="paragraph part2">During <strong>World War I and II</strong> many of these immigrants left Zurich again, because men were conscripted for armed service
      in their home countries. The weak economy and restrictive asylum politics after World War I did the rest. 1945, at
      the end of World War II foreign resident population in Zurich amounted to only <strong>6.8%</strong>.</p>
    <p class="paragraph part3">Since the Swiss industry and infrastructure survived World War II relatively intact, the economic boom in the 50’s lead
      to a turnaround. Due to the increased demand of working force more immigrants moved to Zurich again. Entire neighborhoods
      transformed into multicultural melting pots. In the 50’s many working immigrants came from Italy and by  <strong>1970</strong> almost
      <strong>every second immigrant hold an Italian passport</strong> .</p>
    <p class="paragraph part4">In the following decades immigration remained at high levels and the higher birth rate of immigrant women compared to
      Swiss women contributed to a growing percentage of foreign resident population in Zurich. In the <strong>80’s</strong> and <strong>90’s</strong> the
      civil wars in <strong>Sri Lanka</strong> and <strong>Ex-Yugoslavia</strong> caused many families to flee to Zurich.</p>
    <p class="paragraph part5">Nowadays, immigrants of <strong>171 different nationalities</strong> make up <strong>32.4%</strong> of Zurich’s resident population, most of them originating
      from European countries. Since the entry into force of the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons in 2002, increasingly
      single individuals with a higher level of education from EU/EFTA member states moved to Zurich for work purposes. German
      citizens currently represent almost a quarter of the foreign resident population. Contrary to frequent assumptions
      asylum seekers only represent a very small percentage of the foreign resident population of Zurich.</p>
